# Creators

I always had a fascination towards creators who created something and actually build something impactful.
They can be inventors, scientists, engineers, artists etc. 

We use a lot of products (especially related to technology) that we take for granted.
I always like to go to the roots and see how they actually made it happen.

Here is a list of such creators and their creations. This list is open and you are welcome to add more.
